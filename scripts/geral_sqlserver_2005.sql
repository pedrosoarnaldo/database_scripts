-- Common Significant Wait types with BOL explanations

-- *** Network Related Waits ***
-- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO		Occurs on network writes when the task is blocked behind the network

-- *** Locking Waits ***
-- LCK_M_IX				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire an Intent Exclusive (IX) lock
-- LCK_M_IU				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire an Intent Update (IU) lock
-- LCK_M_S				Occurs when a task is waiting to acquire a Shared lock

-- *** I/O Related Waits ***
-- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION  Occurs when a task is waiting for I/Os to finish
-- IO_COMPLETION		Occurs while waiting for I/O operations to complete. 
--                      This wait type generally represents non-data page I/Os. Data page I/O completion waits appear 
--                      as PAGEIOLATCH_* waits
-- PAGEIOLATCH_SH		Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Shared mode. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.
-- PAGEIOLATCH_EX		Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Exclusive mode. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.
-- WRITELOG             Occurs while waiting for a log flush to complete. 
--                      Common operations that cause log flushes are checkpoints and transaction commits.
-- PAGELATCH_EX			Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is not in an I/O request. 
--                      The latch request is in Exclusive mode.
-- BACKUPIO				Occurs when a backup task is waiting for data, or is waiting for a buffer in which to store data

-- *** CPU Related Waits ***
-- SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD  Occurs when a task voluntarily yields the scheduler for other tasks to execute. 
--                      During this wait the task is waiting for its quantum to be renewed.

-- THREADPOOL			Occurs when a task is waiting for a worker to run on. 
--                      This can indicate that the maximum worker setting is too low, or that batch executions are taking 
--                      unusually long, thus reducing the number of workers available to satisfy other batches.
-- CX_PACKET			Occurs when trying to synchronize the query processor exchange iterator 
--						You may consider lowering the degree of parallelism if contention on this wait type becomes a problem
